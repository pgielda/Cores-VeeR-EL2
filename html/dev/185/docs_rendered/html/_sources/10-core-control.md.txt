# 10 Low-Level Core Control

This chapter describes some low-level core control registers.

## 10.1 Control/Status Registers

A summary of platform-specific control/status registers in CSR space:

* Feature Disable Control Register (mfdc) (see Section 10.1.1)
* Clock Gating Control Register (mcgc) (see Section 10.1.2)

All reserved and unused bits in these control/status registers must be hardwired to '0'.
Unless otherwise noted, all read/write control/status registers must have WARL (Write Any value, Read Legal value) behavior.

### 10.1.1 Feature Disable Control Register (Mfdc)

The mfdc register hosts low-level core control bits to disable specific features.
This may be useful in case a feature intended to increase core performance should prove to have problems.

:::{note}
fence.i instructions are required before and after writes to the mfdc register.
:::

:::{note}
The default state of the controllable features is 'enabled'. Firmware may turn off a feature if needed.
:::

This register is mapped to the non-standard read/write CSR address space.

### 10.1.2 Clock Gating Control Register (Mcgc)

The mcgc register hosts low-level core control bits to override clock gating for specific units.
This may be useful in case a unit intended to be clock gated should prove to have problems when in lower power mode.

:::{note}
Except for PIC I/O, the default state of the clock gating overrides is 'disabled'.
Firmware may turn off clock gating (i.e., set the clock gating override bit) for a specific unit if needed.
:::

This register is mapped to the non-standard read/write CSR address space.
